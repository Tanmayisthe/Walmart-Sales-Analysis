Overview
This project involves analyzing Walmart's sales data to uncover key trends and insights. The primary objective was to gain a deeper understanding of sales performance across various dimensions, such as time, region, and product categories. This analysis is part of my Data Analyst portfolio and aimed at building knowledge in the sales domain.

Data Source
The data used in this analysis was obtained from data.world. It includes detailed records of Walmart's retail transactions, covering multiple years and offering a rich dataset for analysis.

Project Objective
The goal of this project was to uncover sales trends and assess the overall sales performance of Walmart over time. The analysis provides insights into key areas such as sales trends by year, regional performance, and the impact of different product categories on overall sales.

Tools and Technologies Used
+ Excel: Used for data preprocessing, including cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
+ Tableau: Utilized for creating dynamic visualizations and dashboards to present the findings.

Dashboard Overview
The Tableau dashboard consists of several dynamic visualizations, including:

1. Line Chart: "Sales By Order Date" (Year & Month) with a trendline.
2. Column Bars Chart: "Sales By Category."
3. Horizontal Bar Chart: "Sales by Subcategory."
4. Highlight Table: "Top 10 Products By Sales."
5. Pie Chart: "Sales By Region."
6. Horizontal Bar Chart: "Top 5 Customers By Sales."
7. Histogram: "Discount Distribution."

Except for the histogram, all visualizations are dynamic, controlled by a parameter named "Metric," which allows users to switch between viewing data on Sales, Profit, or Order Quantity. Titles and data on the charts update accordingly based on the selected metric. The dashboard also includes:

+ KPI Cards: Displaying Total Sales, Sales Quantity, Average Order Value, Total Orders, and Average Days to Ship.
+ Filters: For Customer Segment and Order Priority.
+ Action Filter: Applied on the "Sales by Category" chart to dynamically interact with the entire dashboard.
